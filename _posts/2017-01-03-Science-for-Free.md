## Scientific papers for free

![](img/science-for-free-content/sheldon-paper.gif?raw=true)

To get a scientific paper, you must use sci-hub.
Sci-hub is a search engine for academic paper, it contain for now more than 48,000,000.

It was created in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a computer neuroscientist student, born in Kazakhstan.

All you have to do, is to paste the link of any paper you want in the search bar of sci-hub, and download it.

The domain name change regularly because of the publishers who file complaints against the website.
You can find it at : [sci-hub.cc](ci-hub.cc) , [sic-hub.io](sic-hub.io) , [sci-hub.bz](sci-hub.bz)

Sci-hub accomplish one of the dreams of internet, the dream that everybody can have an access to knowledge.
But for this moment, sci-hub is illegal.

## Books in PDF for free

## Paper to Video.

Reading is boring and inanimate, a video it's way more funnier.

jove.com is a platform who present scientific methods and protocols in video, it show you technics, tools, and everything about an experiment.
A huge amount of videos are free access, and some are made for educational purposes.

I think it's a amazing way for students to see a lot of laboratory work, and to make link about what you learn in class, and how it's actually done in lab.


Unfortunately a some video are restricted, but there is a little "trick" to obtain every video, by
taking advantage of their trial account policy. [Here is a video I made to explain how you can do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBiqXvVSUbg)

That's it !
I hope this will help you.
Getting Academic content is great, but when you want to learn about a subject,
