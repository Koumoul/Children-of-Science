How to get any scientific paper, any book, and more, for free ?
In this post I will show you some tips to get scientific content.

## Scientific papers for free


To get a scientific paper, you must use sci-hub.
Sci-hub is a search engine for academic paper, it contain for now more than 48,000,000.

It was created in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a computer neuroscientist student, born in Kazakhstan.
In a communicate she explain why she did it :

>I would like to clarify the reasons behind sci-hub.org website. When I was a student in Kazakhstan university, I did not have access to any research papers. These papers I needed for my research project. Payment of 32 dollars is just insane when you need to skim or read tens or hundreds of these papers to do research. I obtained these papers by pirating them. Later I found there are lots and lots of researchers (not even students, but university researchers) just like me, especially in developing countries.


All you have to do, is to paste the link of any paper you want in the search bar of sci-hub, and download it.

![sci-hub]({{ site.url }}/img/science-for-free-content/sci-hub.gif?raw=true)

The domain name change regularly because of the publishers, like Elseviers, who file complaints against the website.
You can find it at : [sci-hub.cc](ci-hub.cc) , [sic-hub.io](sic-hub.io) , [sci-hub.bz](sci-hub.bz)

Sci-hub accomplish one of the dreams of internet, the dream that everybody can have an access to knowledge.
But for this moment, sci-hub is illegal.

## Books in PDF for free

Scientific books are expensive, like, VERY expensive.

One of the best website I know for downloading almost every books you need, about anything, is Library Genesis.

Again it's not rocket science, it's work just like a search engine, here is a gif for you :

You can access this website at http://gen.lib.rus.ec

## Paper to Video.

Reading is boring and inanimate, a video it's way more funnier.

jove.com is a platform who present scientific methods and protocols in video, it show you technics, tools, and everything about an experiment.
A huge amount of videos are free access, and some are made for educational purposes.

I think it's a amazing way for students to see a lot of laboratory work, and to make link about what you learn in class, and how it's actually done in lab.


Unfortunately a some video are restricted, but there is a little "trick" to obtain every video, by
taking advantage of their trial account policy. [Here is a video I made to explain how you can do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBiqXvVSUbg)

That's it !
I hope this will help you.
Getting Academic content is great, but when you want to learn about a subject,
